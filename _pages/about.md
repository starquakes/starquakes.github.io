How do dendrites facilite information processing? How can we wire the understandings from cellular level to high level functionalities in neuroscience? When can I upload myself to a virtual world and live there purely with consciousness? I don't know, but I'm a passionate learner to ask and explore. 

Currently a PhD student in Bio Engineering Laboratory at ETH Zurich, I develop multi-modal approaches and analysis tools by combining advanced functional imaging and high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA) for the investigation of neuronal activity and network modalities. 

Previously, I was trained as a Mechatronics and Microsystem engineer at Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xi'an, China (2011 -- 2018). With almost 6 years research training in different labs and projects, including robotics, microfabrications, sensors and fluidics controls, I decided to move towards the field of Brain-Computer Interface and neurotechnology, which led me to my current group.

Outside of the lab, I love exploring the nature and various outdoor sports. My "not wild" hobbies involve playing the violin, building legos, observing gorillas and doing small tech side-projects to fulfil my own curiousity.
